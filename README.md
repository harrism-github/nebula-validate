# \<nebula-validate\>

Validate forms and data using [Validate.js](https://validatejs.org/)

## Installation

```sh
$ bower install -S arsnebula/nebula-validate
```

## Getting Started

Import the element:

```html
<link rel="import" href="/bower_components/nebula-validate/nebula-validate.html">
```

Add the element and set properties:

```html
<nebula-validate
  id="validator"
  auto-validate
  delay=300
  constraints="[[constraints]]"
  data="[[data]]"
  errors="{{errors}}"
  on-validated="_onValidated">
</nebula-validate>
```

By default, the `autoValidate` property is false. To trigger validation, enable the `autoValidate` property, or call the `validate` method directly.

```js
  this.$.validator.validate()
```
